# Autonomous-robot-Implementation
---------------------------------
OBJECTIVE:
----------
To develop code for a mobile robot using C++ and image processing techniques to autonomously navigate, detect and avoid obstacles, detect and attack/escape from opponents. The code has been developed for two scenarios:

i) The robot chases the opponent robot and tries to hit it with the laser while the opponent robot tries to avoid getting hit. 
ii) The opponent robot chases the user robot and tries to hit it with laser while the user robot avoids getting hit.
